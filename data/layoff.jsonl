According to court documents, Borders doesn't wish to liquidate the 45 stores because they are among the most profitable in its portfolio. But the debtor is unable to assume the leases because, according to court papers, 'various creditor constituencies have indicated that they would oppose any such assumption outside of the context of a sale of the business as a going concern or confirmation of a plan of reorganization'. Borders is 'actively negotiating a going concern sale with multiple potential buyers'.

Orkut enthusiasts can also export their profile data, community posts and photos using Google Takeout. Orkut has been around for a decade and to mark its legacy, Google will preserve all of the site's public communities in an archive.
