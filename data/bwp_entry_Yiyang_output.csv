The company wants to get out of the business of making its own cast-iron engine blocks and vehicle parts, sending that work to suppliers in Canada and Brazil. With about 600 workers, Cleveland Casting is the largest of Ford's three Brook Park plants. Engine Plants No. 1 and No. 2 together employ about another 600. The company announced plans in 2007 to close the casting plant in 2009, but later agreed to extend its life another year. The company also does not have large layoffs scheduled before that date. The company does not classify ending the contracts of temporary workers as layoffs. Company and other union officials have argued that outsourcing all of Ford's engine-block castings is dangerous for the company because the automaker wouldn't have control over quality or pricing. The first casting to go will be the block for the 4.6-liter V-8 engine used in Ford's F-150 pickup and the outgoing version of the Explorer sport utility vehicle. Though jobs are leaving the casting plant, prospects are a bit better at Engine Plant No. 1. That facility makes the 3.7-liter V-6 engine used in the Mustang muscle car and the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6, a turbocharged engine used in the Ford Taurus SHO and several other specialty vehicles. The company expects to add a second shift to that plant later this year as the automaker gets ready to put the EcoBoost V-6 in the F-150. Engineers have said the V-6 truck will be more powerful and significantly more fuel-efficient than some V-8 versions of the F-150, Ford's best-selling product for decades. The company expects the second shift at Engine Plant No. 1 to be added about the same time the casting plant closes, so many workers will transfer instead of losing their jobs.
