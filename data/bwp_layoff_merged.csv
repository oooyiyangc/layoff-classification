ATK employees already know about the pending layoffs. With the help of NASA, ATK was able to identify areas where there were redundancies and made upgrades to its manufacturing and testing to improve the time and cost of making its boosters for its space launch system. NASA's SLS will launch future rockets into space for human exploration. It can be used to launch rockets for both crew and cargo missions. With the approximately 400 changes made to the process, which took a year to implement, the company can save as much as 46% of the assembly time, as well as millions of dollars in projected costs. Although the process is reducing costs and eliminating unnecessary steps in producing the boosters that does not mean the company is taking shortcuts. The steps have not affected the safety of the rockets or increased their risks.",1,,,

Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan will consider the store-closing request at a June 20, 2011 hearing. Borders has been working to get an extension from its landlords for a Sept. 14, 2011 deadline to assume or reject leases. It has obtained an extension for nearly 371, or 90%, of the leases, but not at a remaining 45 locations. According to court documents, Borders doesn't wish to liquidate the 45 stores because they are among the most profitable in its portfolio. But the debtor is unable to assume the leases because, according to court papers, 'various creditor constituencies have indicated that they would oppose any such assumption outside of the context of a sale of the business as a going concern or confirmation of a plan of reorganization'. Borders is 'actively negotiating a going concern sale with multiple potential buyers'. However, if it doesn't commence the store-closing sales before the Sept. 14, 2011 deadline, Borders will be in default on its $505 million debtor-in-possession loan from a group of lenders including GE Capital Corp., GA Capital LLC, Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC, Stone Tower Credit Funding I Ltd. and GB Merchant Partners LLC.

The plant, operated by the company could be fired up in the event of a dramatic power emergency before being decommissioned permanently on Feb. 28, 2011. The impending closure comes after bruising political infighting at City Hall and is a clear victory for residents of the oft-neglected southeast corner of the city. Many residents there suffer from disproportionately high rates of cancer, asthma and other health problems. Some have fought for more than a decade to shut down the plant, which sits between the waterfront and a residential neighborhood. The central sticking point to shutting down the plant was a state requirement that the city have adequate power sources during a major disaster, like an earthquake. The proposed plant would have consisted of three 'peakers' and only used during peak energy demand. The natural-gas turbines would have reduced, but not eliminated, the pollution generated. The plant would also have given the city a reliable generation source if it wanted to embark on a public power plan to provide residents an alternative to utility monopoly Pacific Gas and Electric Co.",1,,,

160329,267069947,"Google announced plans to shut down Orkut, its first attempt at building a social network. The platform will be formally closed on September 30, 2014 after which users will be unable to log in or export their photo albums to Google+. Orkut grew out of Google's 20% initiative, which allowed employees to use a fifth of their working week on side projects. Of course, the social network has since been supplanted by Google+, a more ambitious service that ties into many of Google's other products. The decision to close Orkut is therefore hardly surprising -the fact it took so long is probably more of a shock. Starting June 30, 2014, it will be impossible for newcomers to create a new Orkut account. Existing users can access the service as normal, however; Google says the three-month period should 'give the community time to manage the transition.' Orkut enthusiasts can also export their profile data, community posts and photos using Google Takeout. Orkut has been around for a decade and to mark its legacy, Google will preserve all of the site's public communities in an archive. It's a nice gesture, although users can choose to opt-out by decoupling Orkut from their Google account. The Orkut app will be removed from Google Play and the App Store later June 30, 2014.",,1,,
