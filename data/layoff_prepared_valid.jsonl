{"prompt":"Borders Group, Inc. is looking for approval to conduct going-out-of-business sales at up to 45 more stores. Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan will consider the store-closing request at a June 20, 2011 hearing. Borders has been working to get an extension from its landlords for a Sept. 14, 2011 deadline to assume or reject leases. It has obtained an extension for nearly 371, or 90%, of the leases, but not at a remaining 45 locations. According to court documents, Borders doesn't wish to liquidate the 45 stores because they are among the most profitable in its portfolio. But the debtor is unable to assume the leases because, according to court papers, 'various creditor constituencies have indicated that they would oppose any such assumption outside of the context of a sale of the business as a going concern or confirmation of a plan of reorganization'. Borders is 'actively negotiating a going concern sale with multiple potential buyers'. However, if it doesn't commence the store-closing sales before the Sept. 14, 2011 deadline, Borders will be in default on its $505 million debtor-in-possession loan from a group of lenders including GE Capital Corp., GA Capital LLC, Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC, Stone Tower Credit Funding I Ltd. and GB Merchant Partners LLC. This leaves the Debtors with a Hobson's choice: the debtors can proceed with store closing sales at these stores under these unfortunate circumstances or, if they refuse to do so, risk being placed into default by DIP lenders. Borders is hoping to waive the requirements under the DIP loan, a request that the DIP lenders are currently considering, and hopes to remove many of the 45 stores from the GOB sales list as it continues to negotiate with its lenders. Indeed, Borders sought the right to proceed with GOB sales at 51 stores in its May 8, 2011 motion, but by May 10, 2011 the total had been reduced to 45 after a deal was reached with landlords for six of the stores.
